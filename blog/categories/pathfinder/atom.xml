    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>( Sorry for the non-programming related post. This post is entirely
about role-playing games )</p>

<p>Pathfinder, and D&amp;D of course, has a system of alignments for helping simplify
characterization of different attributes. Such as &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;lawful&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This system actually works really well, and I&rsquo;ve always been a bit confused by
people who don&rsquo;t like it. The system uses words that have meaning, and you can
be anywhere on that alignment axis and play an interesting character. Such as
a character who is neutral or passive regarding good and evil, but cares about
freedom. Or one who cares about good, but doesn&rsquo;t really care about methods
as long as good gets accomplished. Same thing for evil.</p>

<p>Now, yes, it uses the word &ldquo;evil&rdquo; for what most people refer to not only as
evil but also for things that are selfish. However, selfishness throughout
human history has generally been classified as evil, so I still feel like this
is a decent word to encompass the whole concept.</p>

<p>Yes, evil comes, like good, in many gradations from realitively minor selfishness
to the genocidal. Still&hellip; evil.</p>

<p>Fascinatingly enough, using such a thorough system leads to two identifiable
problems: self-aware characters, and self-aware characterization.</p>

<p>These often lead to mismatches between what you thought you knew about a fellow
gamer&rsquo;s PC at the table and the reality.</p>

<p>This happens in real life all the time. Because people have different world views
they tend to place everyone else along some axis of their own without thought
to anything else. So, we might say that objectively speaking someone who has
tried to get you to spy and murder and steal for them in order to help secure
their own power is &ldquo;evil&rdquo;. Objectively.
But it&rsquo;s possible not only that they don&rsquo;t think of themselves that way, but
that through proper manipulation you don&rsquo;t see them that way either.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the classic version of &ldquo;why do you let him/her treat you that way?&rdquo; coming
from your friends who have a more objective view of the situation.</p>

<p>In RPGs, every player has an outside view of the situation. However, if you get
bogged down in how your character views things, and begin to make the same
rationalizations for yourself that your character makes, well&hellip; it makes for
people talking right past one another.</p>

<p>As an example, we had a group that had crashed on an island that turned out to
be run by a group of religious assassins. We had never met them or heard of
them before, and so the group didn&rsquo;t know they were assassins or anything like
that. However, from the very first contact they were hostile. And while we
were able to convince them to release us, since then they have attempted to
manipulate us into spying on our friends, protect their people, and generally
help them maintain an iron clad hold on their power.</p>

<p>A slaver had taken as slaves several NPCs with whom we had made friends, and
this group in control of the island first forbade us to rescue them, and then
went on a killing spree trying to hunt us down once we had freed our friends.</p>

<p>At the end of a session while we were discussing as players what to do next,
my PC, being a freedom loving character, expressed a desire to fight back
against the evil band of assassins. One of the other players expressed
confusion about why we would want to do that since they have been,
in his words, &ldquo;very netural&rdquo; towards us.</p>

<p>This exchange happened because the two characters had very different views
of the events that had gone on. In his mind, they were just defending their
territory and any woe that befell us was due entirely to us crossing them.</p>

<p>So, in many ways, it may help in those situations to separate out what is
meta, that is things that are seen objectively by the players, and what
the characters see and how they naturally react to circumstances differently.
Not unlike how real people often need to &ldquo;put themselves in the shoes&rdquo; of
someone else.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh boy. Yeah. The Pathfinder RPG.</p>

<p>We play this game pretty relentlessly. Throughout that whole experience, years of slogging through
Pathfinder campaigns, we come across a simple problem: Pathfinder has a LOT of conditional
modifiers. Wow. A LOT.</p>

<p>As of now, we keep a rather complicated sheet of certain precalculated sets of modifiers that
tend to affect the whole group, things like Bless or Haste, and have them all added up so that
play can continue smoothly. Depending on how many casters, and what the current level is, the
number of modifiers &mdash; and more importantly the number of modifiers that clash &mdash; can get crazy.</p>

<p>So, as two of us are programmers by trade, we thought to ourselves &ldquo;We can do this electronically&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ah, hubris. That&rsquo;s all fine and well, but definition of the problem became a chore in and of
itself. Luckily we could keep defining down until comfortable with the scope, since we were only
out to please ourselves.</p>

<p>And so&hellip; <a href="http://github.com/darelf/bufftracker">bufftracker</a>. There is a companion web product,
though it is not yet finished. Honestly the base project is not yet finished. As I make more
progress I&rsquo;ll be updating it and probably post more on here about it.</p>

<p>Maybe. I dunno. We&rsquo;ll play it by ear.</p>
