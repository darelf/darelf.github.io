    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The eternal struggle rages on, and in today&rsquo;s episode we bring you the
battle of configuration.</p>

<p>Every useful application is configurable. This is an axiom, a universally
accepted truth about programming. If a software application is to be useful
to a user of any kind, it must allow some way of specifying parameters that
modify its behavior.</p>

<p>For instance, one of the simplest Unix programs of all time, <code>ls</code>, on my
Linux machine has over 50 separate command line switches that allow the
user to modify the behavior. And this is for a program whose sole purpose
is to list files.</p>

<p>The question is not whether a program should accept one or the other. That
way lies madness, since any given program should accept both. The question,
instead, is what should you use?</p>

<h3>Configuration files.</h3>

<p>The pro-config-file argument is compelling. Store your settings a single time.
Easier to run in cron or some other automation. Can be changed at any time,
not merely when the program is about to run. Comments in the file itself
can remind you what the options are for.</p>

<p>The cons for this are obvious. Mainly, if you run the program with different
options very often, editing a file is actually more work than changing the
switches.</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>

<p>Easy. Allows you to quickly modify behavior between several rapid uses of
the same program. Help screen will generally tell you what you need to know.</p>

<p>Tedious if you have many options. Easy to forget if the times between running
the program by hand are very long. Easy to mistype.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>Where possible use both. Set your config file to your common and least-changed
settings, and use the command line for your often changing parameters.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The title might should be &ldquo;Caught between two worlds&rdquo;, but that sounded
really, really pretentious.</p>

<p>So, I had started a project a while back before realizing that something
like browserify existed. I know. I feel like a moron already, don&rsquo;t rub
it in. And even when I started using it I didn&rsquo;t really understand what
it was going to do.</p>

<p>Then, as I got halfway through the project, I realized what was happening
and started doing what I should have done the whole time. So now, the code
for this web application has two completely different approaches that,
while not technically incompatible, make reading and debugging the code
a chore.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I learned in this very specific context:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to use jquery/bootstrap to build a single page web application,
and then using browserify to make a bridge between the client and the node
server. That is, there are modules that run on node, and the application
module is most easily written in node as well. The only problem is how
to communicate between the server and client over what is essentially a
layer on top of websockets.</p>

<p>It turns out, that the cleanest solution to this problem turned out to be
using custom events on DOM elements from the application code, and catching
those events to do the UI parts. That is, some jquery/bootstrap code can
use all of its normal methods and coding style to accomplish the UI
functions, while the node style application code that has been browserified
can simply fire off events without worrying too much about what&rsquo;s going
to happen.</p>

<p>There are some improvements I can make, and will be making, in said
application. Things like passing in the DOM element to the client application
code, and more cleanly setting up the custom javascript DOM events.</p>

<p>All in all, though, stepping through the code again to refactor for all of
this new knowledge makes for better code and I learned a little something
along the way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh boy. Yeah. The Pathfinder RPG.</p>

<p>We play this game pretty relentlessly. Throughout that whole experience, years of slogging through
Pathfinder campaigns, we come across a simple problem: Pathfinder has a LOT of conditional
modifiers. Wow. A LOT.</p>

<p>As of now, we keep a rather complicated sheet of certain precalculated sets of modifiers that
tend to affect the whole group, things like Bless or Haste, and have them all added up so that
play can continue smoothly. Depending on how many casters, and what the current level is, the
number of modifiers &mdash; and more importantly the number of modifiers that clash &mdash; can get crazy.</p>

<p>So, as two of us are programmers by trade, we thought to ourselves &ldquo;We can do this electronically&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ah, hubris. That&rsquo;s all fine and well, but definition of the problem became a chore in and of
itself. Luckily we could keep defining down until comfortable with the scope, since we were only
out to please ourselves.</p>

<p>And so&hellip; <a href="http://github.com/darelf/bufftracker">bufftracker</a>. There is a companion web product,
though it is not yet finished. Honestly the base project is not yet finished. As I make more
progress I&rsquo;ll be updating it and probably post more on here about it.</p>

<p>Maybe. I dunno. We&rsquo;ll play it by ear.</p>
