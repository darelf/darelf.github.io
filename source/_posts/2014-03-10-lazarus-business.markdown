There tends to be, in my experience, a certain bonding moment that
happens among a give group of adventurers. And it usually has to do with loot.
Whether gold or precious gems or magic swords.
<!--more-->
Once someone has shown they can bring the loot, and are willing and eager to
share the loot, many of their minor character flaws are suddenly overlooked.
Suddenly, they see the healing and the support in a new light. Suddenly all
of that now has a context. And that context is loot.

It's good that we retrieved the hold relic. I'll get some brownie points, Mae
and her band of adventurers will get paid.

Everyone seemed very excited about the dragon we met. More than you would
normally expect from a band of seasoned adventurers. It's almost like they are on some
quest looking for a dragon, though this one turned out not to be what they
were looking for. It was a fun ride, I must admit. Seeing the dragon get at
all those dark dwarves was satisfying.

The drow are just as touchy as ever about visitors. Apparently they were
having some sort of picnic in the backyard and we were seen as crashing the
event. You know, we attempted to just quietly walk in, get the relic and walk
out, no fuss. We even went to the trouble to be invisible, and to not be a bother
by going in through the back, avoiding all the hoopla. Paragons of courtesy, we were.

Some people just can't appreciate manners. Which is typical of drow. I mean, really,
sure I did execute a contract on one of them... that one time. And yes, I
did *technically* cut out her heart. And it is *obviously* true that I ate her heart.
And that may or may not have happened in front of her children -- I honestly wasn't
paying a whole lot of attention at that point, can you blame me? -- but,
I mean, what else was I going to do? Not only was I getting paid, this was the
same drow that shortchanged me. The important take away is that if you claim that
there are fourteen potions of cure light wounds, and it turns out there are only
twelve... I mean, what do you expect is going to happen?

Also, I learned that I hate driders. I had only heard rumors, but the reality
is pretty horrible. At least horrible to face in battle.

Makes me regret not bringing more wine.
