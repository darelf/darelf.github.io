There's some sort of northern barbarian that hangs out in Mae's group. Odd fellow.
Keeps to himself mostly. At first I thought he didn't speak the language, until
he went into a semi-furious rant about some vision he had.
<!--more-->
Unfortunately, the vision was of the assassin cult of Norgorber. Those guys. You
know, one of the groups that if you leave them alone they usually leave you alone.
But apparently, this Pike (or Pickaxe, maybe?) fellow crossed them somehow, or maybe someone put out a
contract on him (though I hadn't heard about it). Whatever the reason, he was in
deep, and these assassins are pretty sneaky; you never know who they are.

We staked out their hideout for a few days until we saw they were having a meeting.
Then we quickly discussed tactics.

Now Mae's guards, the three ex-soldiers, seem to be a little light on tactics.
(That may be why they are "ex". That or sleeping on duty seems just as likely)
However, they did manage to have a single stray thought about possible alternate
escape routes for the enemy. But then, instead of actually securing the exit,
instead they sent the pirate Dripstain to take care of it. And he "took care of it"
by drinking and having a piratey good time, and then watching calmly while several
of the enemy escaped.

When asked, he said something like "Oh, you wanted me to stop them? I.. I didn't
know that. I just assumed you wanted me to drink and wench and observe any
of them coming out of the basement. Which I did! Especially the first two items!"

"How many, Dripstain?"

"Oh, maybe three or four. Or maybe it was only one. I was in my fifth cups by
then, and Stacey's ample bosom was blocking some of my view. Plus I was trying to
keep an eye on Jessica, since I thought she might be in on it what with the way
she was swaying her hips at me constantly. Definitely, probably
at least one of the assassins got away." (I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea)

Meanwhile, with Assisstant Vice Cabin Boy busy, we were laying into the enemy pretty
heavily. Not being a group very good at making our way down corridors, we of course
got completely tangled up just getting into the place, tripping over each other.

Mae got the high ground on some barrels to light up the room with arrow fire.
Eventually we got untangled and went face first into assassins, fire elementals,
and giant scorpians. It was invigorating.

The frustration with the entire affair of just getting in the door made me cranky.
I vaguely remember eating a man's heart. It happens sometimes. After that, of course,
everything is a bit fuzzy since I was high as a kite on lifeblood.

Maybe next time we can have a little better organization on getting through the door.
I know. Baby steps, baby steps.
