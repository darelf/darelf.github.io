Taking out comments. Unnecessary.

If you need to contact me or have a comment about a post, send me an email.
Or use the twitter or google plus buttons on the post. I'm down. Down with
the twitters and plusai.

Separating things into categories. That's what I'll be doing.

There should already be a [programming category](http://darelf.github.io/blog/categories/programming)
which should have all of that stuff. If you are only interested in that
part, well, use that category.

I'll be adding character posts about gaming. Right now doing Pathfinder,
so most of the posts will be about characters in that game. Don't sweat it.
If you are only into the Pathfinder part, use the
[Pathfinder category](http://darelf.github.io/blog/categories/pathfinder)
or if you want to know about a specific character, or what's going
on in a specific game you can filter further by their categories.

That's all for now. If you aren't on [Google +](http://plus.google.com) or
on [Twitter](http://twitter.com) let me know; I can add different social
networks.
