Oh boy. Yeah. The Pathfinder RPG.

We play this game pretty relentlessly. Throughout that whole experience, years of slogging through
Pathfinder campaigns, we come across a simple problem: Pathfinder has a LOT of conditional
modifiers. Wow. A LOT.

As of now, we keep a rather complicated sheet of certain precalculated sets of modifiers that
tend to affect the whole group, things like Bless or Haste, and have them all added up so that
play can continue smoothly. Depending on how many casters, and what the current level is, the
number of modifiers -- and more importantly the number of modifiers that clash -- can get crazy.

So, as two of us are programmers by trade, we thought to ourselves "We can do this electronically".

Ah, hubris. That's all fine and well, but definition of the problem became a chore in and of
itself. Luckily we could keep defining down until comfortable with the scope, since we were only
out to please ourselves.

And so... [bufftracker](http://github.com/darelf/bufftracker). There is a companion web product,
though it is not yet finished. Honestly the base project is not yet finished. As I make more
progress I'll be updating it and probably post more on here about it.

Maybe. I dunno. We'll play it by ear.
