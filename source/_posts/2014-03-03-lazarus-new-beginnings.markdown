Journal Entry:

Mae is exactly as I remember her. Something about elves, probably.
<!--more-->
I convinced her to let me help out on some salvage mission. I don't
even know what they were after. She didn't leave with anything,
which was really odd behavior for her.

She has apparently hired some mercenaries. Fairly sure of themselves.
I haven't seen them prove anything yet, but from the scars and scuff
marks they seem to have experience. Apparently, they are some sort
of local semi-celebrities.

I approve, at any rate. They have gathered up Merideth, and have
somehow conspired to protect her until they return to Sargava.

The after party was interesting, and Mae was completely in her element.
While everyone was discussing what to do about some young girl
that had gotten herself kidnapped, Mae slipped out, saved the
girl, came back and pocketed the reward money. Quest complete.

We were all still eating lunch. Classic.

With Mae's help, I convinced her mercenary friends to help
bring back Merideth and to retrieve that artifact for Meron.
Let's hope some of that muscle can be turned to good use.

Aowyn is still operating in the city. If I didn't have a dozen other
priorities I would do something about that. I still may try to have
Mae acquire one of her poisoned weapons for me, kill Aowyn's associate
with whom she seems to have some animosity, and leave the weapon to
be found with the body. Some guy named "Scurvyder" or something.

Sitting here in camp with some pervy merc named Marcandus or
Mercurius or something. Just one of those types who at very first
look makes you immediately suspicious. Maybe he'll cozy up to the
camp follower we brought along. Isn't that why we bring them, so
they can satisfy the odd inclination?

Speaking of which, why didn't we think to bring some of the girls
from town? Why does this guy get to bring his own personal boy and
none of the rest of us get anything? This is ridiculous. I only
brought one bottle of wine, too. That's not going to last.
