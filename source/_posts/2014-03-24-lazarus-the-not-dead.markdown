Having gotten themselves banned from the city, the adventuring group led by Mae approached the
walls with not a little trepidation. Unfortunately, the Red Mantis had a use for the group and
offered to clear their names in exchange for some help. This was obviously not going to play to
my advantage. The Mantis are constantly interfering, the meddlesome brats.

Help from adventuring groups is usually of the "kill it until it is dead" variety, and this one
was no different. Apparently, the necromantic pirate lady ( I think her name was Necrophilia, or
something? ), had one of her ships occupying the harbor. Who knows why. Certainly for some
nefarious purpose, but which exact type of nefary was unclear.

What was clear, was that a ship full of the not-quite-dead was blocking the harbor from the
wholly legitimate and upright citizens of Ilizmagorti. *cue eye roll*. So, they bundled us onto
a barge, basically keel-hauling us into doing their dirty work, and so we had not much choice
other than to clear out the undead and sink the ship.

Which brings me to the question of loot. Loot? What loot? I see no loot here. I see no reward for
sinking the ship. I see no upside at all. The pirates should have cleared it out, since they are
the ones for whom the main use and advantage of the harbor is.

Regardless. Dripstain the Pirate God certainly showed his value in sea-going situations. He charged
every enemy, fought from the front and generally energized the entire affair. His pure, piratey
enthusiasm infected the whole group, and everyone got caught up in the Swash and Buckle. It was
a fascinating excursion, from that point of view.

Also, I don't particularly like undead. They are irritating. They suck the souls out of people,
and reduce them to at best wasted husks, and at worst convert them to their undead cause. Which
cause is entirely depressing. I assume most undead are cutters by nature, all sad on themselves,
blaming their parents, etc. If they had hair it would naturally fall in their face and be dyed
black. Whatever. I prefer a more energetic lifestyle.

At least we got to sink a ship by setting it on fire. That's always fun.
